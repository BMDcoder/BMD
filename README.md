This project is the react version of [Material Kit](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-kit) from [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/).<br />
The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io).

## Install

To install run the following commands in your terminal:
```
git clone git@github.com:creativetimofficial/material-kit-react.git
cd material-kit-react
yarn install
```

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
